# Welcome

Welcome to Nexpo - Next generation Expo!

This project aims to to supply [ARKAD](https://arkad.tlth.se) with an inhouse project management system.

## Development

Development is fairly straightforward but require some dependencies:

- `yarn` is needed for package management and to run scripts
- A version of the backend is needed and the easiest way is to create one with `docker` so you need to have that installed as well

### Set up backend

1. Clone the backend repository where you want to store it: `git clone https://github.com/careerfairsystems/nexpo-backend`
2. Enter the created folder: `cd nexpo-backend`
3. Switch branch to the docker-enabled version: `git checkout docker`
4. Build and start the backend: `docker-compose up -d`
5. Wait a few minutes for the backend to compile and start (a faster way is being tested but not finished yet). You can check the progress by running `docker-compose logs app` and if you see a mention of the server running on port 4000 you are ready to move to the next step
6. Seed the database. This is needed because we need to populate the database with some data so we can log in and access the backend. You can seed the database by running: `docker-compose exec mix run priv/repo/seeds.exs`
7. Done! You can now use this command to **start** the backend: `docker-compose up -d` and to **stop** the backend: `docker-compose down` and you don't have to repeat all the steps next time you want to use the backend

### Set up the frontend

1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/careerfairsystems/nexpo-web`
2. Change directory to the created folder: `cd nexpp-web`
3. Install all the dependencies: `yarn install`
4. Run the development server: `yarn start`
5. To stop the server, simply press Ctrl+C. You can access the app on localhost:3000, the first time you access it can be very slow (30+ seconds) but the next will be fast.

At the moment node version 12 is required. (Optional: For nvm users run nvm use in the terminal to apply the right node version.)

**\*\*\*** ATTENTION **\*\*\***
The content below is outdated and from a time where the backend and frontend were entwined together. It can no longer be called relevant and we need to update it. Not everything is outdated though so if you wonder something you can take a look at it but don't think of it as the ultimate truth.

# Technical Description

The frontend is configured with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). It handles all build configuration which makes our lifes much easier. Do not eject from the default configuration. Create React App has a fantastic [User Guide](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

# Development

## Setup environment

1. Make sure you have installed all [system requirements](#system-requirements). Then open a terminal and do the following steps
2. Install the following programs
   - `npm` - version 5 or higher. [Installation instructions](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
3. Navigate yourself to the project root using the terminal.
4. Based on your running dist do one of the following:
   - Mac:
     - Execute `make install-mac`
   - Linux:
     - Open the following file: `config/dev.exs`
     - After `poolsize: 10`, add `username: "nexpo", password: "nexpo"`. Do not forget to add a `,` after poolsize.
     - Do the same thing for `config/test`
     - Execute `make install-linux`
5. Grab a cup of coffee!
6. Start the stack with `npm run dev`

## Implement things

### Development lifecycle

1. Checkout and pull latest from master
2. Make a local branch with `git checkout -b featurename`
3. Install dependencies (if necessary) with `yarn add`
4. Migrate or Reset database (if necessary) with `mix ecto.migrate` or `mix ecto.reset`
5. Populate database with mock data with `mix run priv/repo/seeds.exs`
6. Start the frontend with `yarn start`
7. Create your feature with [TDD](#recap-of-tdd)
8. Commit, and make a pull request
9. Wait for pull request to be accepted by someone
   - Review others pull requests
10. If pull request is merged, and all tests pass, your feature is automatically deployed to production

### Testing

This project is developed with [TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development). \
This means that all code should be tested. We are urging all developers to follow this for the following reasons

- You will know for sure if you break anything when touching the code
- We are changing developers every year. You will make everything easier for the next team!

#### Recap of TDD:

1. Write a test
2. Make sure it fails
3. Implement code that makes it pass
4. Make sure your code is pretty and scalable

These are some commands to help you run all tests

| Command                   | Description                     |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `yarn test`               | Runs all tests                  |
| `yarn testwatch-frontend` | Starts testwatcher for frontend |

#### Writing tests for frontend

- All tests should be beside what is it testing. If there is a component named `Component`, its test should be beside it and named `Component.test.js`
- The frontend is configured with [jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) as its testrunner.
- For react tests, the project is configured with [enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme). This makes it easy to unit test a component
- There are test helpers in [/priv/react_app/src/TestHelper](/priv/react_app/src/TestHelper)

## Helpful things

## Dev servers

| Command      | Description    |
| ------------ | -------------- |
| `yarn start` | Start frontend |

- Backend server is running on localhost:4000
  - Visit [localhost:4000/sent_emails](http://localhost:4000/sent_emails) to see emails sent in development
- Frontend server is run on localhost:3000
  - All api-calls are proxied transparently to the backend
